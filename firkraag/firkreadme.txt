I.  Why?

	Before we begin this section, let me assure you that I am not now, nor have I ever been a
masochist.  The actual original reason for this mod was a comment made on the Sorcerer's Place 
boards.  This particular poster in question thought that even Weimer's Improved Dragon AI scripts
were too weak.  As I was in the process of studying the AI in-game, I decided to take on the 
challenge of making a Firkraag so tough that even the hardcore tacticians would be screaming for 
mercy.  This is the first of those experimental scripts.

	I am constantly attempting to improve this script until I come up with one that simply 
cannot be beaten until the very end of the game, as dragons should be.  For reference, I was able
to beat the Tactics Improved Firkraag in Chapter 2 with my Cavalier.  That is not very flattering
for what is supposed to be one of the most powerful beasts in all of Faerun.

	This mod should make Firkraag the incredibly powerful magic-user and dragon that he should
be.  I'm issuing a challenge for all you masters of cheese out there to come up with methods to 
beat this guy.  I intend to remove them in future versions (yes, you'll get credit for the idea).


II.  Installation Instructions

	If you want to have Tactics mod installed (www.weidu.org- I heartily recommend it) then it
must be installed before this mod.  Generally, Super Firkraag needs to be installed last.  It is 
compatible with every mod that I'm aware of.

	Installation is simple.  Run the executable that is included in the ZIP file.  If you have
other WeiDU mods, you'll need to run it twice (the installer will tell you).  Simply select your 
favorite language and pick yes when asked to install.

III.  Known Bugs

	The only known bug is a PARSE_ERROR command on a .sto file in your override directory 
(possibly a mod?).  Ignore this.  I have no idea what causes this, but it doesn't seem to affect 
anything.  This mod doesn't touch that file, regardless.

IV.  Support and Help

	I currently maintain a forum at rpgdungeon.myikonboard.com.  You're welcome to post 
anything there about either the game itself or any mod.  I check it daily, as do a few of the 
other prominent names in the modding community.  I will help you come up with a method to beat 
this Firkraag if you ask nicely, but don't expect that exploit to work in future versions!

V.  Uninstallation

	Found Firkraag to be more than your cup of tea?  No problem.  Simply re-run 
setup-Firkraag.exe.  The program will give you the option to uninstall.  This will return the 
Firkaag to the "factory-fresh state."  Note that I'm unsure whether this will affect anything if 
you've already visited him.  If so and you're totally stumped, Ctrl-Y him.

VI.  Special Thanks

Strifestrike- For coming up with the idea for this mod and being one of my original testers
Beren- The first person that I know of to have beaten the Firkraag mod.  He was my primary tester
       and a really swell guy!
Community at SP- For supporting my modding hobby and providing a good environment
Weimer- I actually used his scripts as a basis for making this one.  He also developed the WeiDU 
        tool, which is what this mod uses
